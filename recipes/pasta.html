        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>500 g of dried spaghetti</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li> Half a cup of olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of red chilli flakes </li>
            <li> Quarter of a cup of chopped parsley</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h2>How to prepare the aglio e oglio </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>While cooking the pasta, place the garlic and olive oil into a pan and heat on
                medium to high heat. </li>
            <li>Stir the mixture until the garlic is golden. Ensure that it is not burned.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>

        <p><h2> Cooking instructions:</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the dried spaghetti into a pot of water containing salt </li>
            <li>Once the pasta is cooked al dente (cooked with a firm texture), remove it from
                the boiling water and put it into a pan containing the aglio e oglio sauce. See above
            for instructions on how to create the aglio e oglio. </li>
            <li>Add 1/3 cup of the pasta water into the pan with the pasta and sauce and gently
                toss the pasta through chilli flakes and parsley. This will give the pasta a glossy appearance, as tossing the pasta finishes
            the cooking process while the water and oil emulsify. </li>
            <li> Add salt and pepper according to your preferences.</li>
        </ol>
